# Creating a Formula

First see [the Homebrew documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/#contributors) and [the Formula Cookbook](https://docs.brew.sh/Formula-Cookbook.html).

## Citation

Include a citation to the tool before the `desc`. For example:

```ruby
  # cite Smith_2010: "https://doi.org/10.1234/56789"
```

The citation label is the first author's surname and year of publication separated by an underscore. Please use `doi.org` to look up the citation label for a DOI:

```sh
curl -LH "Accept: text/bibliography; style=bibtex" "https://doi.org/10.1234/56789"
```
